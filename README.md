# Lung Nodule Detection and Localization

## Introduction

The detection and localization of lung nodules are critical for early diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer. Traditional methods rely on visual interpretation by radiologists, which can be subjective and time-consuming. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques have been explored for automated lung nodule detection. However, the complexity of lung nodules and limitations in image processing techniques make accurate detection and localization challenging.

This project aims to address these challenges by utilizing graph-based representations of CT scan lung images and employing a graph convolutional neural network to classify nodules and estimate their locations.

## Problem Statement

The primary objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive framework for efficient detection and localization of lung nodules using CT scan images. The framework converts these images into graphs, capturing spatial and contextual information effectively. By enabling multidimensional views of these graphs and employing advanced graph analysis techniques, we seek to enhance the accuracy and reliability of lung nodule detection.

## Project Overview

The proposed framework consists of the following key components:

1. **Data Pre-processing**: Initial steps involve cleaning and preparing the CT scan images for analysis.

2. **Feature Extraction**: Relevant features are extracted from the images to aid in nodule detection.

3. **Graph Creation**: CT scan images are converted into graph structures to represent complex relationships between lung structures.

4. **Prediction of Nodules**: Machine learning algorithms are applied to classify and accurately identify lung nodules. Precise localization of nodules within the lung structure is a crucial output.

## Methodology

The methodology employed in this project includes the following steps:

- **Data Pre-processing**: Cleaning, noise reduction, and normalization of CT scan images to ensure data quality.

- **Feature Extraction**: Extraction of relevant features from the images that can assist in nodule identification.

- **Graph Creation**: Transformation of CT scan images into graph structures. Nodes represent various lung regions or structures, while edges indicate connections or similarities.

- **Prediction of Nodules**: Machine learning algorithms or computational techniques are used for nodule classification and precise localization within the lung structure.
